# linear-regression-implimentation-from-scrath-Numpy-
This project is build to make a linear regression model from sracth with the help of numpy and with the use of matrix multiplication, matrix transpose and matrix addition. This project is build to pridict the outcome with the given input and the linear relation between the input and the output.

Concepts implimented:
Linear model: y_prediction = XW + b
Mean Squared Error
Gradient Descent
Learning rate experimentation

What I learned:
Why adding a bias in the model is important 
WHy gradient matter
Why learning rate affects stability
What happens with small vs large gradient
